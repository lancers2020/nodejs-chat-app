  This is not a working app as far as backend development is concerned. Upon loggin in, you should use the default username 'admin' and password 'admin'.
  since i've been focusing more on the frontend development, adjusting to the required backend tech stack was very hard, if not impossible given that I've only got 2 days making this one, during which time I've spent most of my hours learning the backend side. I'll probably explore more on the backend side once I consider myself an intermediate level frontend developer. I don't expect to pass the exam, but I'm still hopeful for the future opportunities that I'll be getting sooner or later. Thanks!
